# Deploying iRODS and YODA at SILS and IBED
The idea is to test how we could use iRODS and possibly YODA to enhance our research analyses. 

## iRODS use cases
To test the possible scenarios in which iRODS could be used. 
1. Genomics 
2. XX
3. YY
4. etc.

## People currently involved 
- Berend Wijers, computational support staff (IBED).
- Evelien Jongepier, bioinformatician (IBED).
- Frans van der Kloet, research assistant (SILS).
- Marc Galland, support scientist for code/data (SILS).
- Arthur Newton, Advisor Data Management Services (SURFsara).

## Prospective people that could be involved
- Someone from astronomy affiliated with Astron/LOFAR: they already use iRODS massively (PB/year).
