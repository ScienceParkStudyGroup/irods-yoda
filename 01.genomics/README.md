# Genomics use case
The aim of this use case is to show how to gather gene expression NGS datasets from public repositories and a private vault powered by iRODS. 

## ENA search 
Quoting the README file: 
> The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) is a database with a comprehensive record 
of nucleotide sequencing information (raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information and functional annotation). The data contained in ENA can be accessed manually or programmatically via REST URLs. However, building HTTP-based REST requests is not always straightforward - a user friendly, high-level access is needed to make it easier to interact with ENA programmatically.
